# Text Summurization models

This repo is built to implement multiple abstractive methods to address text summurization , it is built to simply run on google colab , and to simply connect to your drive , so you would only need an internet connection to run these examples without the need to have a powerful machine , so all the code examples would be in a jupiter format .

  - The first ipython is a modification on of David Currie's https://github.com/Currie32/Text-Summarization-with-Amazon-Reviews seq2seq , to make it work with tf 1.11 , and to make it connect to google drive , it is built as a seq2seq model , with multi layer lstm encoder , and a decoder with bahadau attention model
